    <h2>Our Project</h2>
    <p>
        CozyBakes is a group project developed for Web Server Application Development. Our team collaborated
        to create a full-featured baking website that demonstrates modern web technologies, responsive design,
        and user-centered functionality. From recipe browsing to seasonal categories and helpful baking tips,
        we built this platform to showcase our skills in both frontend and backend development.

                        I was the backend and database developer. I designed the models (Recipe, Ingredient, RecipeIngredient, Category),
                        configured EF Core, ran migrations, and populated seed data in the DbContext. I recently made changes to the seed
                        data by adding six more recipes, more ingredients, and additional tags.

                    <td>
                        I served as the UI and Frontend Developer for the CozyBakes project. I designed and built
                        the layout, styling, and overall visual flow of the site, including the navigation, page
                        structure, and responsive design. I enjoy baking because it lets me be creative while making
                        something comforting for others. Throughout this project, I learned more about creativity within
                        UI design and working as a team to bring all of our pieces together.

                    <td>
                        I worked as the backend developer for the project. I helped integrate different pieces of functionality
                        between the backend and frontend to help the application function correctly. Overall, I love baking because
                        it helps put creativity into food. I enjoyed working as the backend developer because it made me appreciate
                        team collaboration.

    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <p>
        Our team utilized modern web development tools and frameworks to create CozyBakes. The application
        is built with ASP.NET Core MVC and C#, using Razor views for the frontend and Entity Framework Core
        for data access and database management.
    </p>
    <p>
        We implemented features like seasonal recipe filtering, type-based browsing, and a baking tips section
        to support ingredient substitutions and helpful hints. The project demonstrates our understanding of
        MVC architecture, routing, model binding, and user interface design principles.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project allowed us to apply concepts learned in class while exploring creative solutions to
        real-world web development challenges.
